# Cinematography Reference Guide

Comprehensive reference for cinematic terminology to enhance Veo 3.1 prompts.

## Camera Shots by Framing

**Extreme Wide Shot (EWS)**
- Shows vast landscapes or cityscapes
- Subject is tiny or barely visible
- Establishes scale and context
- Example: "Extreme wide shot of a lone figure on an endless desert"

**Wide Shot (WS) / Long Shot (LS)**
- Shows subject head to toe with surrounding environment
- Establishes location and subject's relationship to space
- Example: "Wide shot of a cowboy standing in the dusty main street"

**Full Shot**
- Shows entire subject from head to toe
- Less emphasis on environment than wide shot
- Example: "Full shot of a dancer in mid-leap"

**Medium Wide Shot / Cowboy Shot**
- Frames subject from mid-thigh up
- Named for classic westerns showing holstered guns
- Example: "Cowboy shot of the detective with hand near his holster"

**Medium Shot (MS)**
- Frames subject from waist up
- Conversational, natural framing
- Most common for dialogue
- Example: "Medium shot of two colleagues discussing at a desk"

**Medium Close-Up (MCU)**
- Frames subject from chest/shoulders up
- More intimate than medium shot
- Good for emotional scenes
- Example: "Medium close-up of the witness giving testimony"

**Close-Up (CU)**
- Frames subject's face, filling most of frame
- Reveals emotion and detail
- Creates intimacy with subject
- Example: "Close-up of the woman's face as tears well in her eyes"

**Extreme Close-Up (ECU)**
- Shows a specific detail (eyes, hands, object)
- Creates intensity and focus
- Reveals fine details
- Example: "Extreme close-up of trembling fingers reaching for a doorknob"

## Camera Angles

**Eye Level**
- Camera at subject's eye height
- Neutral, realistic perspective
- Most common angle

**High Angle / Bird's Eye**
- Camera above subject looking down
- Can make subject appear vulnerable or small
- Good for establishing shots
- Example: "High angle shot looking down on the crowded marketplace"

**Low Angle**
- Camera below subject looking up
- Makes subject appear powerful, dominant, or imposing
- Dramatic effect
- Example: "Low angle shot of the villain towering over the frame"

**Dutch Angle / Canted Angle**
- Camera tilted on its axis
- Creates unease, disorientation, tension
- Common in horror and thrillers
- Example: "Dutch angle shot of the asylum hallway, walls tilting at unsettling angles"

**Overhead / Top-Down**
- Camera directly above subject
- Abstract, stylized perspective
- Good for symmetry and patterns
- Example: "Overhead shot of the chess board with two hands hovering"

## Camera Movements

**Static Shot**
- Camera remains still
- Lets action unfold within frame
- Creates stability and focus

**Pan**
- Camera rotates horizontally left or right on fixed point
- Reveals space or follows action
- Example: "Slow pan across the abandoned warehouse"

**Tilt**
- Camera rotates vertically up or down on fixed point
- Reveals height or scale
- Example: "Tilt up from the character's feet to their face"

**Dolly / Track / Truck**
- Camera moves toward or away from subject on tracks
- Smooth, controlled movement
- Creates depth and dimension
- Dolly in: moves toward subject (intensifies)
- Dolly out: moves away from subject (reveals context)
- Example: "Slow dolly in on the speaker as tension builds"

**Tracking Shot / Traveling Shot**
- Camera follows subject's movement
- Creates energy and momentum
- Example: "Tracking shot following the runner through the forest"

**Crane Shot / Boom Shot**
- Camera moves vertically on crane arm
- Often combines vertical with horizontal movement
- Dramatic, sweeping movements
- Example: "Crane shot ascending from street level to rooftop view"

**Steadicam / Handheld**
- Camera operator walks with camera
- Steadicam: smooth, floating movement
- Handheld: more raw, documentary feel
- Example: "Steadicam shot weaving through the crowded party"

**Zoom**
- Lens focal length changes (not camera movement)
- Zoom in: magnifies subject
- Zoom out: reveals more context
- Less cinematic than dolly movement
- Example: "Slow zoom on the mysterious package"

**Arc Shot / Orbit**
- Camera circles around subject
- Creates 360-degree view
- Dynamic, revealing movement
- Example: "Arc shot circling the two fighters"

**Push In**
- Fast dolly toward subject
- Creates urgency or emphasis
- Example: "Quick push in on the protagonist's shocked expression"

**Pull Out / Pull Back**
- Camera moves away from subject
- Often reveals unexpected context
- Example: "Pull out from close-up revealing the character is surrounded"

## Advanced Camera Techniques

**Whip Pan / Swish Pan**
- Extremely fast pan creating motion blur
- Transition device or shows urgency
- Example: "Whip pan from character A to character B"

**Rack Focus**
- Shift focus from foreground to background or vice versa
- Directs attention between subjects
- Example: "Rack focus from the gun in foreground to the target in background"

**Dolly Zoom / Vertigo Effect**
- Dolly and zoom simultaneously in opposite directions
- Creates disorienting, warped perspective
- Expresses psychological disturbance
- Example: "Dolly zoom on the character realizing the truth"

**Crash Zoom**
- Fast zoom in or out
- Dramatic emphasis
- Common in horror and comedy
- Example: "Crash zoom into the ticking clock"

**POV Shot (Point of View)**
- Camera shows scene from character's perspective
- Creates subjective experience
- Example: "POV shot from inside the car looking at the approaching intersection"

**Over-the-Shoulder (OTS)**
- Camera positioned behind character looking at another
- Common in dialogue scenes
- Creates conversational context
- Example: "Over-the-shoulder shot of the interviewer's perspective"

## Lens & Focus Characteristics

**Shallow Depth of Field**
- Narrow focus range
- Subject sharp, background blurred (bokeh)
- Creates separation and intimacy
- Achieved with wide aperture (low f-stop)
- Example: "Shallow depth of field with the flower sharp and garden blurred behind"

**Deep Focus / Deep Depth of Field**
- Everything in frame is sharp
- Foreground and background both in focus
- Creates layers and complexity
- Achieved with narrow aperture (high f-stop)
- Example: "Deep focus shot with activity visible on multiple planes"

**Wide-Angle Lens**
- Broad field of view
- Exaggerates depth and space
- Can distort at extreme widths
- Example: "Wide-angle lens making the small room feel expansive"

**Telephoto Lens**
- Narrow field of view
- Compresses depth (things appear closer together)
- Natural for portraits
- Example: "Telephoto shot compressing the busy street into a wall of traffic"

**Macro Lens**
- Extreme close-up capability
- Shows tiny details at large scale
- Example: "Macro lens revealing water droplets on a leaf"

**Soft Focus**
- Slightly out of focus for dreamy effect
- Often achieved with filters
- Romantic, nostalgic mood
- Example: "Soft focus on the couple's first dance"
