## Finding Your Carrier

**Q: How do I find out which carrier is delivering my Amazon order?**

A: Go to "Your Orders" on Amazon, select "Track Package" next to your order, and you'll see the carrier name and tracking number listed. Note that if you ordered multiple items, each package might be delivered by a different carrier.

**Q: Can I track all my Amazon packages the same way?**

A: Most packages can be tracked, but some packages like standard international deliveries might not be trackable. For third-party seller orders, you can only view tracking information if the seller shares it with Amazon and you chose a trackable shipping option.

## When to Contact a Carrier

**Q: When should I contact the delivery carrier directly instead of Amazon?**

A: Contact the carrier directly to:
- Find a package that shows as delivered but you can't locate
- Get updates if your delivery is late
- Change your delivery address or update delivery instructions
- Update your safe place for deliveries
- Get detailed tracking information
- Reschedule your delivery
- Request photo proof of delivery (if applicable)

Note that only Amazon can view the delivery details in Your Orders, so some changes require contacting Amazon directly.

**Q: What should I do if my package shows as delivered but I can't find it?**

A: First, check your safe place and ask neighbors or household members. If you still can't locate it, contact the carrier directly using the contact information provided in your order details. You can also visit Amazon's "Find a Missing Package That Shows As Delivered" help page.

## Tracking Your Package

**Q: How do I track my Amazon package?**

A: Go to "Your Orders," find the order you want to track, and select "Track Package" next to your order. You'll see delivery updates and tracking numbers. If you ordered multiple items, they may have separate delivery dates and tracking information for each package.

**Q: What do the different delivery statuses mean?**

A: Amazon uses these delivery statuses:
- **Arriving**: Usually followed by a date - your package is on its way
- **Out for delivery**: Your package will be delivered today
- **Delivered**: Your package has been delivered and might be in your designated safe space
- **Undeliverable**: Your package couldn't be delivered and will be returned to Amazon, after which you'll automatically receive a refund

**Q: My order hasn't shipped yet but it's supposed to arrive today - should I be worried?**

A: This is normal. Depending on the carrier, items may ship the same day they're delivered, so you might not see a status update until delivery. If your package doesn't arrive by the expected date, wait 48 hours as most late parcels arrive within that timeframe due to weather, traffic, or other delays.

## Carrier Contact Information

**Q: How do I contact Royal Mail about my Amazon delivery?**

A: You can contact Royal Mail by phone at +44 (0) 3457 740 740, or visit their website at Royal Mail's tracking and support pages.

**Q: What are the contact details for DPD deliveries?**

A: Call DPD at 0121 275 0500. For DPD tracking numbers beginning with "AW," use the Asendia tracking website at https://uktracking.asendia.com/tracking-pb.php.

**Q: How do I reach EVRi (formerly Hermes) about my Amazon order?**

A: For orders sold and fulfilled by Amazon only, live chat is available at https://www.evri.com/help-and-support/help-centre. EVRi primarily uses live chat for customer support rather than phone contact.

**Q: What are Yodel's contact hours?**

A: Call Yodel at 03447550117. They're available Monday to Friday 8am-8pm, Saturday 8am-6pm, and Sunday 9am-5pm.

**Q: How do I contact Amazon Logistics about my delivery?**

A: If Amazon is delivering your order directly, contact Amazon Customer Service through your Amazon account rather than a separate carrier phone number.

## Damaged or Defective Items

**Q: What should I do if I receive a damaged, defective, or broken item from Amazon?**

A: Go to "Your Orders" and select "Return or replace items" beside the affected item. Choose the item you want to replace, select a reason for return, and follow the on-screen instructions. Amazon may ask you to upload photos showing the damage clearly to help review the issue.

**Q: Can I get a replacement for a damaged item or do I have to return it first?**

A: Amazon will create a replacement order with the same shipping speed as your original item. However, the replacement may only be shipped after you send the original item back to Amazon. You must return the original by the "Return By Date" provided to avoid being charged for both items. Amazon recommends shipping back the original item as soon as you request a replacement.

**Q: What if the item I received as a gift is damaged?**

A: If a gift item doesn't have a replacement option, you'll need to return the original item through the Gift Returns process and place a new order separately.

## Delivery Problems

**Q: My order is delayed - what should I do?**

A: Delays can occur due to weather, traffic, or other factors. Most late parcels arrive within 48 hours of the estimated delivery date. If your order has already shipped, you cannot cancel it. Check your tracking information for updates, or contact the carrier for more detailed information.

**Q: I received my package but items are missing - what happened?**

A: Missing items may have been shipped separately. Check "Your Orders" to see if there are additional packages in transit. If not, visit Amazon's "Find a Missing Item" help page for further assistance.

**Q: What does "Undeliverable" mean and what happens next?**

A: "Undeliverable" means your package couldn't be delivered and will be returned to Amazon. Once Amazon receives the returned package, they will automatically issue you a refund. You can learn more on Amazon's "Undeliverable Packages" help page.

## International Deliveries

**Q: How do I contact carriers for international Amazon deliveries?**

A: Amazon works with various international carriers depending on the destination country. Check your order details to find which carrier is handling your delivery, then use the carrier contact information list provided in the "Contact a Carrier" help page. Contact details vary by country and carrier, including options like Chronopost (France), Correos (Spain), Post NL (Netherlands), and many others across Europe.

**Q: Who do I contact about customs clearance issues for international orders?**

A: This depends on your carrier and location. For example, if your order is being delivered by EKOL and you have customs clearance issues, contact their import Customs broker Kerry Logistics at +90 212 603 32 39 (8am-5pm Monday to Friday). Check your specific carrier's information for customs support contacts.

## Third-Party Sellers

**Q: How do I track packages from third-party sellers on Amazon?**

A: Third-party sellers are independent businesses selling on Amazon Marketplace. You can check if your order is from a third-party seller by going to "Your Orders" and reviewing the seller name. Tracking information is only available if the seller shares it with Amazon and you chose a trackable shipping option. For help with third-party orders, you may need to contact the seller directly.

**Q: What should I do if I have issues with an item from a third-party seller?**

A: For issues with items sold and shipped by third-party sellers, learn about Amazon's A-to-z Guarantee, which is a free commercial warranty that may cover your purchase. You can also contact the third-party seller directly through your order details.
