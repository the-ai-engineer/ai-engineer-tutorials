## General Returns Policy

**Q: How long do I have to return items purchased on Amazon.co.uk?**

A: You have a statutory right to cancel most orders within 14 days of receiving the item. Additionally, Amazon offers a voluntary 30-day returns policy for most products, allowing you to return items within 30 days of receipt if they are unused and undamaged. Note that Amazon Haul items have a separate 15-day return window.

**Q: What condition must items be in when I return them to Amazon?**

A: Items must be returned in the same condition as received. New items must be unused and undamaged, while used items must not have any additional signs of use or damage. You must also remove all personal data from electronic devices before returning them.

**Q: How long does it take to receive a refund from Amazon?**

A: Amazon will issue a refund within a maximum of 14 days and confirm it with an automated email. The refund should appear in your bank account or credit card statement within a maximum of 7 business days after the refund is issued, though in certain circumstances timeframes may be longer.

## Return Costs

**Q: Will Amazon refund my return shipping costs?**

A: Yes, Amazon will refund the cost of returning items sold or dispatched by Amazon in most cases. You'll typically receive a pre-paid returns label. However, if the item isn't eligible for free return and you use a pre-paid label, the return cost will be deducted from your refund. UK return costs start at £3.99, and international returns start at £8.09.

**Q: Are return shipping costs covered for fashion items like shoes, clothing, and jewellery?**

A: Yes, Amazon refunds return shipping costs for shoes, clothing, handbags, jewellery, and watches, even if you're simply cancelling the order (not due to defects).

**Q: How much does it cost to return heavy and bulky items?**

A: Heavy and bulky items (weighing 31.5kg or more, or with longest side exceeding 175cm when packed) require collection. If the item is damaged, defective, or incorrect within 30 days, collection is free. For other return reasons, Amazon may deduct a £50 home collection cost from your refund.

## Return Methods

**Q: What methods can I use to return items to Amazon?**

A: Amazon offers several return options depending on your item:
- Drop-off services at convenient locations
- Heavy-bulky return options with specialty carriers
- Amazon Locker and Hub Counter locations for small packages
- QR code scanning at designated locations for label-free and package-free returns

## Defective or Damaged Items

**Q: What should I do if I receive a damaged, defective, or incorrect item?**

**Q: What happens if my item becomes defective after the 30-day return period?**

A: If your item becomes defective after 30 days, Amazon will repair the item through the manufacturer or an authorised repair service. If repair isn't possible, you'll receive a replacement, and if replacement isn't available, you'll get a refund. This applies to qualifying items sold by Amazon.co.uk or Amazon Resale, but not to consumable products or defects caused by accidental damage, deliberate damage, external factors, or general wear and tear.

## Special Product Categories

**Q: Can I return customised or personalised products to Amazon?**

A: Customised products (with engravings, stamps, monograms, embroidery, etc.) are not returnable. However, they may be refunded or replaced within 30 days if they arrive damaged, defective, or materially different from what was ordered, or if there's a spelling/configuration error made by the seller.

**Q: What are the return requirements for Luxury Stores items?**

A: Luxury Stores products must be returned within 30 days in new (where applicable), unused, and unaltered condition with all attached tags, hygiene seals, and accessories. Free return shipping is provided. Specific requirements include: shoes must be tried on carpeted surfaces only, lingerie/swimwear must be tried on over underwear with protective strips intact, and all brand packaging and documentation must be returned.

**Q: Can I return Amazon Haul items?**

A: Yes, Amazon Haul items can be returned with no return costs if requested within 15 days of delivery and items are in new, unused, and unaltered condition. Haul items are not eligible for the standard 30-day voluntary returns policy and must be packaged separately from other Amazon orders.

**Q: Are Amazon Fresh items returnable?**

A: Items purchased at Amazon Fresh stores are refundable within 30 days of purchase. However, the majority of Amazon Fresh food items aren't returnable but may be refunded. See Amazon's help pages for information on requesting refunds for spilled or damaged Fresh items.

**Q: How do I return items purchased from a Marketplace Seller?**

A: If your order was sold and dispatched by a Marketplace Seller, you'll need to follow the process for arranging Marketplace returns and refunds, which may differ from Amazon's standard return process.

## Common Issues

**Q: What happens if I accidentally return the wrong item to Amazon?**

A: Ensure you enclose the correct and complete item when making a return. If you've accidentally sent the wrong item, contact Customer Service immediately. Amazon does not store mistakenly sent items and cannot guarantee your item will be found and returned. No compensation is provided for incorrect items sent to Amazon.

**Q: What should I do before returning electronic devices with stored data?**

A: You must entirely delete, remove, and eliminate all personal data from electronic devices (laptops, cameras, etc.) before returning them. You must also de-latch any accounts linked to the item. You will be fully responsible for any data breach if you fail to do so.
